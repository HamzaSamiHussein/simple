    COURSE:
    Week 1:
    Welcome to Introduction to HTML5. This course is an introduction to how web pages are created, sent across the
    Internet,
    and viewed on your computer, tablet, or smartphone. This course is meant for the absolute beginner, but also touches
    on
    information that may be new to someone who has been using HTML for some years. In particular, the new options
    available
    in HTML5 and some recommended policies for making sure that your page is accessible.

    Explain:
    This course teaches the absolute beginners on how to use HTML5
    appropriately and how to use the semantics meanings in meaningfully way
    that will enhance your web SEO and accessability. Also it mention that it touches new information to those who has
    been
    using HTML for some years.

    ------
    COURSE:
    HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, a way of marking up files so that browsers (Internet Explorer, Chrome,
    Safari, Edge, etc) know how to display your content as a webpage. HTML uses tags to distinguish between content
    (what the user should see) and the instructions for displaying them (make this a list, make this a link to a
    different page, show this picture, etc...) There are so many things you can do with HTML. While it is possible to
    make a long list of HTML tags, this approach won't help you as much as practice with a smaller subset.

    Explain:
    HTML: stands for HyperText Markup Language

    HyperText (النص التشعبي أو النص الفأئق): It means that a text on page can be referred to another page.

    Markup(توصيف أو ترميز): Tags that used to describe our content we create on the document.

    Language: A language that computer system understands and uses to interpret commands

    In easy terms HTML determines the structure and marking up files of
    so the web browsers know how to display your content as a webpages.

    Also, the HTML uses <b>tags</b> to distinguihs between 1- what the user
    see and instructions of how to displaying them to the "user".

    ------
    COURSE:
    Therefore we focus on the following:

    What HTML is and how we got from the original version to HTML5

    The "magic" behind the Internet and how your web page isn't just one file, but many pieced put together by your
    browser using something called the Response/Request Cycle

    The syntax behind the tags -- how to write good syntactic HTML.

    The semantics behind the tags - some tags have special meaning and are extremely useful if you want to make your
    pages accessible. Accessible pages are ones that can be accessed by the widest range of people and that includes
    those who have physical or cognitive disabilities.

    Getting your page on the web - This class will not require you to post your site on the Internet. However, you will
    learn how to publish your site if you choose. (And we hope you do and share your work with me and others in the
    class.)


    Explain:
    So we will focus on this week on the following topics:

    * What is HTML?
    * How we from original version (HTML) to HTML5?
    * How the Internet works and how you get the pages you want?
    * The semantics of tags (the meaning of them), all the tags have
    special meaning and therefore we decide what the apporbiate content we
    write inside them. And this plays a big part of make your page is accessbile to more wider audiensce who does have
    dissabilites that strict them have an safe and successfuull access to your page.
    these dissabalites have types and we will discuss them later.

    * You learn how to publish your page on the internet.

    ------

    COURSE:
    This course assumes absolutely no previous knowledge. In each module you will be asked to do the following:

    Watch video lectures.
    The information has been broken down into pieces to help you learn the material in the smallest chunks that still
    give you enough information to do something with it. The goal is to give you the ability to listen to these during
    any time you have. You will find that some of the videos have material that makes sense to you at once. Sometimes
    you may want to replay other videos to clarify the material. Some of the videos are not traditional lectures,
    instead they are videos where I demonstrate the concepts from an earlier lecture. I highly recommend that you code
    along with me while you watch these videos. The key to success in this course is in writing code. I put these videos
    in so that you have something specific to practice. It is also a great way for you to see how often I mess up when I
    am coding!!


    Explain:
    How this course works ?

    EXPLAIN THEM HOW TO STUDY EFFECTIVELY:

    1st: WATCH the video
    3rd: Summarize the video
    4th: Read the article
    5th: Summarize the article
    6th: Do the quiz
    7th: re-do the quiz until they get full-mark
    8th: Add some features on their own on the project they do.
